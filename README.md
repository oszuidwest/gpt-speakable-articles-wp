Speakable Articles is a WordPress plugin that helps radio stations that use Wordpress. It generates a speakable summary of an article on publish using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API and stores it in postmeta. It does this in Dutch, as it's made for [Omroepstichting ZuidWest](https://www.zuidwestfm.nl). It's easy to change the language. Just modify the word "Dutch" in the prompt on line 22 and replace it with your language.

## Installation
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/speakable-articles` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the Settings -> Speakable Articles screen to configure the plugin.

## Settings
To use the plugin, you need an OpenAI API key. Enter your API key on the settings page.

## Latest Articles with Speakable Summaries
The plugin adds a new page under the Speakable Articles menu in the WordPress admin. This page shows the latest articles with speakable summaries. You can copy the summary by clicking the "Copy Summary" button.
